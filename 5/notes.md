#Control Structures

##What does the following program print:

```
i := 10
if i > 10 {
  fmt.Println("Big")
} else {
  fmt.Println("Small")
}
```

- it prints "Small" ( without the speech marks ) because i is not greater than 10 

##Write a program that prints out all the numbers evenly divisible by 3 between 1 and 100. (3, 6, 9, etc.)

- see divisibe_by_3.go

##Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of 
##the number and for the multiples of five print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".

- see fizz_buzz.go
